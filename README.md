# gmailApp

-> Before starting, client credentials for google api is required. The credentials need to be stored in json format as credentials.json:
{"installed":
    {"client_id":"",
        "project_id":"",
        "auth_uri":"",
        "token_uri":"",
        "auth_provider_x509_cert_url":"",
        "client_secret":"",
        "redirect_uris":["http://localhost:3000/oauth2callback"]
        }}
 in this format.
 
-> Then, the acces,refresh etc. tokens can be generated by running authenticate.js and authorising the client to access the gmail resource in readonly mode. The tokens will be stored as tokens.json to be used by index.js.
 The index.js file can then be run to fetch the results.

-> fetch.js can be used to generate the results for a particular day/hour
